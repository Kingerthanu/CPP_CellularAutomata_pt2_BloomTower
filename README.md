# CPP_CellularAutomata_pt2_BloomTower
A C++ OpenGL Hexagonal-Grid Cellular Automata Using Probability And Sine Waves To Create Breathing System. This is another file dump of my hexagonal-grid framework for cellular automata with some things changed in my Cell class, as well as giving a bigger grid to work with for more detailed patterns. Currently is being inefficient with color scaling and wish to do uniform passing of brightness scalars for each cell instead of manually changing the buffer data as is chugging CPU runtime.
This project gave me a very interesting look into how Sine and Cosine can be used in real world applications of algorithms for "seasonal" dialing.

Also probability in this project gave me a much more comfortable understanding on how we can use probability in our conditionals and thinking of its implementation more as a abstract trait of our given cells.
